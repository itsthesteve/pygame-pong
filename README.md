# Simple Pong

While listening to a YouTube video about programming, the creator mentioned that one could make Pong
in a few weekends just for the kicks, so I decided to give it a go.

I used pygame and might venture into recreating it in the browser with Canvas, but that's for
another day.

If you want to run this, you'll need a font named "pong-font.ttf" in the root. I didn't upload it
due to licensing restrictions, but for dev I used
[this one](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323?preview.text=pong&query=v&classification=Monospace)
from Google Fonts.

Setup:

```
$> python3 -m venv venv
$> . ./venv/bin/activate
$> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$> python3 main.py
```

### Controls

- Up/Down arrows for player 1
- W/S keys for player 2

Optimizations, effects, etc.
